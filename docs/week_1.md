For the first week, I experimented with SoundPlayer. Hoped to have worked with ofArduino and OfSerial, but my teensyduino was sitting at home. Forgot that I'd left that and other materials at home. Completed by this week is playing an Mp3 and starting and stopping with a press of the spacebar. Goals for next review: experinented with communicating with the arduino and preparing data to be communicated with it.
