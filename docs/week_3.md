for this week i fleshed out the fast fourier transform capabilities to prepare for when my LED Strips come. Once i processed the music in this way, i added a basic visual representation of what im going for with the led strips. Then, I took a few small samples and prepared a small hardware demonstration (a few LEDs attatched to the arduino) that emulates what is displayed on the screen.
